    "## Running evolution from the command line\n",
    "\n",
    "We used the jupyter notebooks, but I did not use jupyter notebook with DidgeLab until I wrote this tutorial. Usually I use command line tools. Here I want to show how I run an evolution over the command line. Usually I do this on a strong server computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "My evolutionary experiments are stored in folder cad/evo. In order to run e.g. the MbeyaEvo, I open a terminal in the src folder and then type\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python -m cad.evo.evolve_mbeya -n_threads 50 -n_generations 1000 -n_generation_size 100 -n_poolsize 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters `n_generations` and `n_generation_size` should be familiar from the last tutorial. `n_poolsize` is the size of the mutant pool. `n_threads` defines how many threads compute the loss function in parallel. A generation size of 100 means that DidgeLab creates 100 mutations in each pool, which means 1000 mutations. Creating a mutation is very fast. But computing the acoustical simulation takes a while. So with `n_threads=50`, the system will start 50 threads that compute losses and the acoustical simulation in parallel. When the loss for all 1000 mutations in the generation is computed, DidgeLab selects the best mutant in each pool (or the father, if no mutant was better) and starts the next generation. It does not make sense to have a number of `n_threads` higher than the number of cpu cores in your computer."

    "* fundamental loss: the fundamental note should be D1 (-31)\n",
    "* octave_loss: the first toot should be an octave\n",
    "* tuning_loss: all other toots should be tuned in the minor scale. The scale parameter has value `[0,2,3,5,7,9,10]`. So all \"allowed\" toots are fundamental + 0 semitones (which is the D), fundamental + 2 semitones (E), fundamental + 3 semitones (F) and so on, so all toots should have notes D, E, F, G, A, Bb, C, in whichever octave.\n",
    "* volume loss: Each resonant frequency should be as loud as possible\n",
    "* n_note_loss: The didge should have at least 4 toots. Otherwise, the natural evolution will find didgeridoos with as little toots as possible, to keep tuning_loss and octave_loss low. Also, many toots are cool.\n",
    "* diameter_loss: A didgeridoo should always get wider along the bore. If it gets narrower then it will get more quiet. Therefore, we want to penalize forms that go narrower.\n",
